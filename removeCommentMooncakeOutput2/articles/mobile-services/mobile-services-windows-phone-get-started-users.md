# Add authentication to your Mobile Services app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-users-legacy](../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-users-legacy.md)]

##Overview

This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Azure Mobile Services from your app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:

1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]
3. [Add authentication to the app]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Add Mobile Services to an existing app]. 

>[AZURE.NOTE]This tutorial demonstrates the authentication flow managed by Mobile Services using a variety of identity providers. This method is easy to configure and supports multiple providers. By using client-managed authentication, your app has access to additional user data maintained by the identity provider. You can get the same user data in your mobile service by by calling the **user.getIdentities()** function in server scripts. For more information, see [this post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/carlosfigueira/archive/2013/12/16/enhanced-users-feature-in-azure-mobile-services.aspx).

&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Phone, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Add Mobile Services to an existing app](/documentation/articles/mobile-services-windows-phone-get-started-data).

&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Press the F5 key to run this quickstart-based app; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts. This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the *TodoItem* table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

In the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users](/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-service-side-authorization), you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
