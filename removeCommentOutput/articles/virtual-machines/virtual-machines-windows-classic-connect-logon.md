# Log on to a Windows virtual machine using the Azure Classic Management Portal
In the Azure Classic Management Portal, you use the **Connect** button to start a Remote Desktop session and log on to a Windows VM.

Do you want to connect to a Linux VM? See [How to log on to a virtual machine running Linux](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-mac-create-ssh-keys/).

Learn how to [perform these steps using new Azure portal](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-connect-logon/).
