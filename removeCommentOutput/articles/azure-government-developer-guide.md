## <a name="Overview"></a>Overview

Windows Azure Government is a separate instance of the Windows Azure service addressing the security and compliance needs of U.S. federal agencies, state and local governments and their solutions providers. Azure Government offers physical and network isolation from non-U.S. government deployments and provides screened U.S. personnel. 

Microsoft provides a number of tools to create and deploy cloud applications to Microsoft's global Windows Azure service (“Global Service”) and Windows Azure Government services.

When creating and deploying applications to the Azure Government Services, as opposed to the Global Service, developers need to know the key differences of the two services.  Specifically around setting up and configuring their programming environment, configuring endpoints, writing applications, and deploying them as services to Azure Government.

The information in this document summarizes those differences and supplements the information available on the [Azure Government](http://www.windowsazure.cn/gov "Azure Government") site and the [Windows Azure Technical Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/cloud-app-development-msdn "MSDN") on MSDN. Official information may also be available in many other locations such as the [Windows Azure Trust Center](/support/trust-center/ "Windows Azure Trust Center"), [Azure Documentation Center](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/) and in [Azure Blogs](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/ "Azure Blogs"). 

This content is intended for partners and developers who are deploying to Windows Azure Government.



## <a name="Guidance"></a>Guidance for Developers
Because most of the technical content that is available currently assumes that applications are being developed for the Global Service rather than for Windows Azure Government, it's important for you to ensure that developers are aware of key differences for applications developed to be hosted in Azure Government.

- First, there are services and feature differences, this means that certain features that are in specific regions of the Global Service may not be available in Azure Government.

- Second, for features that are offered in Azure Government, there are configuration differences from the Global Service.  Therefore, you should review your sample code, configurations and steps to ensure that you are building and executing within the Azure Government Cloud Services environment.
