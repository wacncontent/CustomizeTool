## Health model
Service Fabric introduces a health model that provides a rich, flexible and extensible reporting and evaluation functionality for Service Fabric entities. Service Fabric components report health out of the box on all entities. User services can enrich the health data with information specific to their logic, reported on themselves or other entities in the cluster. To learn more, read:
