# Placement Constraints Overview

Service Fabric allows developers to constrain the placement of service replicas on to nodes that satisfy particular conditions. These conditions are expressed via a boolean expression that is evaluated with appropriate service-context specific values.


## Capabilities
By using Placement Constraints, you can:

- Confine different type of services on different types of nodes via defining NodeProperties on the nodes.

- Apply certain constraints to primary replicas but not secondary replicas


## Key Concepts
NodeProperty- A user or system defined map from a string to a value, that can vary over each node, i.e NodeName.
