# Deploy your first web app to Azure in five minutes

This tutorial helps you deploy your first web app to [Azure App Service](/documentation/articles/app-service-value-prop-what-is/).
You can use App Service to create web apps, [mobile app back ends](/documentation/services/app-service/mobile/),
and [API apps](/documentation/articles/app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform/).

You will: 

- Create a web app in Azure App Service.
- Deploy sample code (choose between ASP.NET, PHP, Node.js, Java, or Python).
- See your code running live in production.
- Update your web app the same way you would [push Git commits](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push).

>[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-linux](../../includes/app-service-linux.md)] 
## Prerequisites

- [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Azure CLI](/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/).
- A Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can 

[sign up for a trial](/pricing/1rmb-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Deploy a web app

Let's deploy a web app to Azure App Service.

1. Open a new Windows command prompt, PowerShell window, Linux shell, or OS X terminal. Run `git --version` and `azure --version` to verify that Git and Azure CLI
are installed on your machine.

    ![Test installation of CLI tools for your first web app in Azure](./media/app-service-web-get-started/1-test-tools.png)

    If you haven't installed the tools, see [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) for download links.

3. Log in to Azure like this:

        azure login

    Follow the help message to continue the login process.

    ![Log in to Azure to create your first web app](./media/app-service-web-get-started/3-azure-login.png)

4. Change Azure CLI into ASM mode, then set the deployment user for App Service. You will deploy code using the credentials later.

        azure config mode asm
        azure site deployment user set --username <username> --pass <password>






1. Use the following PowerShell Commands to enable local git repo for your app.

        $a = Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceId /subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourcegroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<web app name>/Config/web -ApiVersion 2015-08-01

        $a.Properties.scmType = "LocalGit"

        Set-AzureRmResource -PropertyObject $a.Properties -ResourceId /subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourcegroups/<resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<web app name>/Config/web -ApiVersion 2015-08-01





1. Change to a working directory (`CD`) and clone the sample app like this:

        git clone <github_sample_url>

    ![Clone the app sample code for your first web app in Azure](./media/app-service-web-get-started/2-clone-sample.png)

    For *&lt;github_sample_url>*, use one of the following URLs, depending on the framework that you like:

    - HTML+CSS+JS: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-html-get-started.git](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-html-get-started.git)
    - ASP.NET: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-dotnet-get-started.git](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-dotnet-get-started.git)
    - PHP (CodeIgniter): [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-php-get-started.git](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-php-get-started.git)
    - Node.js (Express): [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-nodejs-get-started.git](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-nodejs-get-started.git)
    - Java: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-java-get-started.git](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-java-get-started.git)
    - Python (Django): [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-python-get-started.git](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-python-get-started.git)

2. Change to the repository of your sample app. For example:

        cd app-service-web-html-get-started

4. Create the App Service app resource in Azure with a unique app name and the deployment user you configured earlier. When you're prompted, specify the number of the desired region.

        azure site create <app_name> --git --gitusername <username>

    ![Create the Azure resource for your first web app in Azure](./media/app-service-web-get-started/4-create-site.png)
    Your app is created in Azure now. Also, your current directory is Git-initialized and connected to the new App Service app as a Git remote.
    You can browse to the app URL (http://&lt;app_name>.chinacloudsites.cn) to see the beautiful default HTML page, but let's actually get your code there now.
4. Deploy your sample code to your Azure app like you would push any code with Git. When prompted, use the password you configured earlier.

        git push azure master

    ![Push code to your first web app in Azure](./media/app-service-web-get-started/5-push-code.png)

    If you used one of the language frameworks, you'll see different output. `git push` not only puts code in Azure, but also triggers deployment tasks
    in the deployment engine. If you have any package.json
    (Node.js) or requirements.txt (Python) files in your project (repository) root, or if you have a packages.config file in your ASP.NET project, the deployment
    script restores the required packages for you. You can also [enable the Composer extension](/documentation/articles/web-sites-php-mysql-deploy-use-git/#composer) to automatically process composer.json files
    in your PHP app.

Congratulations, you have deployed your app to Azure App Service.
## See your app running live
To see your app running live in Azure, run this command from any directory in your repository:
    azure site browse

## Make updates to your app

You can now use Git to push from your project (repository) root anytime to make an update to the live site. You do it the same way as when you deployed your code
the first time. For example, every time you want to push a new change that you've tested locally, just run the following commands from your project 
(repository) root:

    git add .
    git commit -m "<your_message>"
    git push azure master

## Next steps

Find the preferred development and deployment steps for your language framework:

- [.NET](/documentation/articles/web-sites-dotnet-get-started/)
- [PHP](/documentation/articles/app-service-web-php-get-started/)
- [Node.js](/documentation/articles/app-service-web-nodejs-get-started/)
- [Python](/documentation/articles/web-sites-python-ptvs-django-mysql/)

Or, do more with your first web app. For example:

- Try out [other ways to deploy your code to Azure](/documentation/articles/web-sites-deploy/).
- Take your Azure app to the next level. Authenticate your users. Scale it based on demand. Set up some performance alerts. All with a few clicks. See 
[Add functionality to your first web app](/documentation/articles/app-service-web-get-started-2/).
