# Restore a web site in Azure Websites

This article shows you how to restore an Azure Website that you have previously backed up by using the [Azure Websites](/documentation/services/web-sites) Backup feature. For more information, see [Azure Websites Backups](/documentation/articles/web-sites-backup).

The Azure Websites Restore feature lets you restore your web site with its linked databases (SQL Database or MySQL) on-demand to a previous state, or create a new web site based on one of your original web site's backup. Creating a new web site that runs in parallel to the latest version can be useful for A/B testing.

The Azure Websites Restore feature, available on the **Backups** blade in the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.cn), is available only in Standard  pricing tiers. For information about scaling your app using Standard  tier, see [Scale a web site in Azure Websites](/documentation/articles/web-sites-scale).

## Download or delete a backup from a storage account

1. On the **Backups** tab, click **Restore Now** in the command bar at the bottom of the portal page. The **Restore Now** dialog box appears.
	
	![Choose backup source][ChooseBackupSource]
	
2. Under **Choose backup source**, select **Storage Account File**. Here you can directly specify the URL for the storage account file, or click the folder icon to navigate to blob storage and specify the backup file. This example chooses the folder icon.
	
	![Storage Account File][StorageAccountFile]
	
3. Click the folder icon to open the **Browse Cloud Storage** dialog box.
	
	![Browse Cloud Storage][BrowseCloudStorage]
	

4. Expand the name of the storage account that you want to use, and then select ** Websitebackups**, which contains your backups.
5. Select the zip file containing the backup that you want to restore, and then click **Open**.
6. The Storage account file has been selected and shows in the storage account box. Click the right arrow to continue.
	
	![Storage Account File Selected][StorageAccountFileSelected]
	
7. Continue with the section that follows, [Choose Your  Website Restore Settings and Start the Restore Operation](#RestoreSettings).

<a name="RestoreSettings"></a>
##Choose Your  Website Restore Settings and Start the Restore Operation
1. Under **Choose your  Website restore settings**, **Restore To**, select either **Current  Website** or **New  Website instance**.
	
	![Choose your  Website restore settings][ChooseRestoreSettings]
	
	If you select **Current  Website**, your existing  Website will be overwritten by the backup that you selected (destructive restore). All changes you have made to the  Website since the time of the chosen backup will be permanently removed, and the restore operation cannot be undone. During the restore operation, your current  Website will be temporarily unavailable, and you will be warned to this effect.
	
	If you select **New  Website instance**, a new  Website will be created in the same region with the name that you specify. (By default, the new name is **restored-***old WebsiteName*.) 
	
	The site that you restore will contain the same content and configuration that were made in the portal for the original site. It will also include any databases that you choose to include in the next step.
2. If you want to restore a database along with your  Website, under **Included Databases**, select the name of the database server that you want to restore the database to by using the dropdown under **Restore To**. You can also choose to create a new database server to restore to, or choose **Don't Restore** to not restore the database, which is the default. 
	
	After you have chosen the server name, specify the name of the target database for the restore in the **Database Name** box.
	
	If your restore includes one or more databases, you can select **Automatically adjust connection strings** to update your connection strings stored in the backup to point to your new database, or database server, as appropriate. You should verify that all functionality related to databases works as expected after the restore completes.
	
	![Choose database server host][ChooseDBServer]
	
	> [AZURE.NOTE] You cannot restore a SQL database with the same name to the same SQL Server. You must choose either a different database name or a different SQL Server host to restore the database to. 
	
	> [AZURE.NOTE] You can restore a MySQL database with the same name to the same server, but be aware that this will clear out the existing content stored in the MySQL database.	
	
3. If you choose to restore an existing database, you will need to provide a user name and password. If you choose to restore to a new database, you will need to provide a new database name:
	
	![Restore to a new SQL database][RestoreToNewSQLDB]
	
	Click the right arrow to continue.	
4. If you chose to create a new database, you will need to provide credentials and other initial configuration information for the database in the next dialog. The example here shows a new SQL database. (The options for a new MySQL database are somewhat different.)
	
	![New SQL database settings][NewSQLDBConfig]
	
5. Click the check mark to start the restore operation. When it completes, the new  Website instance (if that is the restore option you chose) will be visible in the list of  Websites in the portal.

2. You are taken to the Management Services portal **Operation Logs** page, where you can see the log for your restore operation in the list of operation logs:
	
	![Management Services Operation Logs page][ManagementServicesOperationLogsList]
	
3. To view details about the operation, select the operation in the list, and then click the **Details** button in the command bar.
