# Provision and deploy microservices predictably in Azure #

This tutorial shows how to provision and deploy an application composed of [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) in [Azure App Service](/home/features/app-service/) as a single unit and in a predictable manner using JSON resource group templates and PowerShell scripting. 

When provisioning and deploying high-scale applications that are composed of highly decoupled microservices, repeatability and predictability are crucial to success. [Azure App Service](/home/features/app-service/) enables you to create microservices that include web apps, mobile apps, and API apps. [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview) enables you to manage all the microservices as a unit, together with resource dependencies such as database and source control settings. Now, you can also deploy such an application using JSON templates and simple PowerShell scripting.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-web-to-api-and-mobile](../../includes/app-service-web-to-api-and-mobile.md)] 

## What you will do ##

In the tutorial, you will deploy an application that includes:

-	Two web apps (i.e. two microservices)
-	A backend SQL Database
-	App settings, connection strings, and source control
-	alerts, autoscaling settings

## Tools you will use ##

In this tutorial, you will use the following tools. Since it's not comprehensive discussion on tools, I'm going to stick to the end-to-end scenario and just give you a brief intro to each, and where you can find more information on it. 

### Azure Resource Manager templates (JSON) ###
 
Every time you create a web app in Azure App Service, for example, Azure Resource Manager uses a JSON template to create the entire resource group with the component resources.For information on how to download and use these templates, see [Using Azure PowerShell with Azure Resource Manager](/documentation/articles/powershell-azure-resource-manager/).

For more information on the Azure Resource Manager templates, see [Authoring Azure Resource Manager Templates](/documentation/articles/resource-group-authoring-templates/)

### Azure SDK 2.6 for Visual Studio ###

The newest SDK contains improvements to the Resource Manager template support in the JSON editor. You can use this to quickly create a resource group template from scratch or open an existing JSON template (such as a downloaded gallery template) for modification, populate the parameters file, and even deploy the resource group directly from an Azure Resource Group solution.

For more information, see [Azure SDK 2.6 for Visual Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/04/29/announcing-the-azure-sdk-2-6-for-net/).

### Azure PowerShell 0.8.0 or later ###

Beginning in version 0.8.0, the Azure PowerShell installation includes the Azure Resource Manager module in addition to the Azure module. This new module enables you to script the deployment of resource groups.

For more information, see [Using Azure PowerShell with Azure Resource Manager](/documentation/articles/powershell-azure-resource-manager/)

### Deploy to Azure button ###

If you use GitHub for source control, you can put a [Deploy to Azure button](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/11/13/deploy-to-azure-button-for-azure-websites-2/) into your README.MD, which enables a turn-key deployment UI to Azure. While you can do this for any simple web app, you can extend this to enable deploying an entire resource group by putting an azuredeploy.json file in the repository root. This JSON file, which contains the resource group template, will be used by the Deploy to Azure button to create the resource group. For an example, see the [ToDoApp](https://github.com/azure-appservice-samples/ToDoApp) sample, which you will use in this tutorial.

## Get the sample resource group template ##

So now let's get right to it.

1. 	Navigate to the [ToDoApp](https://github.com/azure-appservice-samples/ToDoApp) App Service sample.

2.	 In readme.md, click **Deploy to Azure**.
 
3.	You're taken to the [deploy-to-azure](https://deploy.azure.com) site and asked to input deployment parameters. Notice that most of the fields are populated with the repository name and some random strings for you. You can change all the fields if you want, but the only things you have to enter are the SQL Server administrative login and the password, then click **Next**.
 
	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/gettemplate-1-deploybuttonui.png)

4.	Next, click **Deploy** to start the deployment process. Once the process runs to completion, click the http://todoapp*XXXX*.chinacloudsites.cn link to browse the deployed application. 

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/gettemplate-2-deployprogress.png)

	The UI would be a little slow when you first browse to it because the apps are just starting up, but convince yourself that it's a fully-functional application.

5.	Back in the Deploy page, click the **Manage** link to see the new application in the Azure Portal Preview.

6.	In the **Essentials** dropdown, click the resource group link. Note also that the web app is already connected to the GitHub repository under **External Project**. 

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/gettemplate-3-portalresourcegroup.png)
 
7.	In the resource group blade, note that there are already two web apps in the resource group.

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/gettemplate-4-portalresourcegroupclicked.png)
 
Everything that you just saw in a few short minutes is a fully deployed two-microservice application, with all the components, dependencies, settings, database, and continuous publishing, set up by an automated orchestration in Azure Resource Manager. All this was done by two things:

-	The Deploy to Azure button
-	azuredeploy.json in the repo root

You can deploy this same application tens, hundreds, or thousands of times and have the exact same configuration every time. The repeatability and the predictability of this approach enables you to deploy high-scale applications with ease and confidence.

## Examine (or edit) AZUREDEPLOY.JSON ##

Now let's look at how the GitHub repository was set up. You will be using the JSON editor in the Azure .NET SDK, so if you haven't already installed [Azure .NET SDK 2.6](/downloads/), do it now.

1.	Clone the [ToDoApp](https://github.com/azure-appservice-samples/ToDoApp) repository using your favorite git tool. In the screenshot below, I'm doing this in the Team Explorer in Visual Studio 2013.

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/examinejson-1-vsclone.png)

2.	From the repository root, open azuredeploy.json in Visual Studio. If you don't see the JSON Outline pane, you need to install Azure .NET SDK.

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/examinejson-2-vsjsoneditor.png)

I'm not going to describe every detail of the JSON format, but the [More Resources](#resources) section has links for learning the resource group template language. Here, I'm just going to show you the interesting features that can help you get started in making your own custom template for app deployment.

### Parameters ###

Take a look at the parameters section to see that most of these parameters are what the **Deploy to Azure** button prompts you to input. The site behind the **Deploy to Azure** button populates the input UI using the parameters defined in azuredeploy.json. These parameters are used throughout the resource definitions, such as resource names, property values, etc.

### Resources ###

In the resources node, you can see that 4 top-level resources are defined, including a SQL Server instance, an App Service plan, and two web apps. 

#### App Service plan ####

Let's start with a simple root-level resource in the JSON. In the JSON Outline, click the App Service plan named **[hostingPlanName]** to highlight the corresponding JSON code. 

![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/examinejson-3-appserviceplan.png)

Note that the `type` element specifies the string for an App Service plan (it was called a server farm a long, long time ago), and other elements and properties are filled in using the parameters defined in the JSON file, and this resource doesn't have any nested resources.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Note also that the value of `apiVersion` tells Azure which version of the REST API to use the JSON resource definition with, and it can affect how the resource should be formatted inside the `{}`. 

#### SQL Server ####

Next, click on the SQL Server resource named **SQLServer** in the JSON Outline.

![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/examinejson-4-sqlserver.png)
 
Note the following about the highlighted JSON code:

-	The use of parameters ensures that the created resources are named and configured in a way that makes them consistent with one another.
-	The SQLServer resource has two nested resources, each has a different value for `type`.
-	The nested resources inside `"resources": […]`, where the database and the firewall rules are defined, have a `dependsOn` element that specifies the resource ID of the root-level SQLServer resource. This tells Azure Resource Manager, "before you create this resource, that other resource must already exist; and if that other resource is defined in the template, then create that one first".

	>[AZURE.NOTE] For detailed information on how to use the `resourceId()` function, see [Azure Resource Manager Template Functions](/documentation/articles/resource-group-template-functions/).

-	The effect of the `dependsOn` element is that Azure Resource Manager can know which resources can be created in parallel and which resources must be created sequentially. 

#### Web app ####

Now, let's move on to the actual web apps themselves, which are more complicated. Click the [variables('apiSiteName')] web app in the JSON Outline to highlight its JSON code. You'll notice that things are getting much more interesting. For this purpose, I'll talk about the features one by one:

##### Root resource #####

The web app depends on two different resources. This means that Azure Resource Manager will create the web app only after both the App Service plan and the SQL Server instance are created.

![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/examinejson-5-webapproot.png)

##### App settings #####

The app settings are also defined as a nested resource.

![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/examinejson-6-webappsettings.png)

In the `properties` element for `config/appsettings`, you have two app settings in the format `"<name>" : "<value>"`.

-	`PROJECT` is a [KUDU setting](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Customizing-deployments) that tells Azure deployment which project to use in a multi-project Visual Studio solution. I will show you later how source control is configured, but since the ToDoApp code is in a multi-project Visual Studio solution, we need this setting.
-	`clientUrl` is simply an app setting that the application code uses.

##### Connection strings #####

The connection strings are also defined as a nested resource.

![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/examinejson-7-webappconnstr.png)

In the `properties` element for `config/connectionstrings`, each connection string is also defined as a name:value pair, with the specific format of `"<name>" : {"value": "…", "type": "…"}`. For the `type` element, possible values are `MySql`, `SQLServer`, `SQLAzure`, and `Custom`.

>[AZURE.TIP] For a definitive list of the connection string types, run the following command in Azure PowerShell:
	\[Enum]::GetNames("Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.Utilities.Websites.Services.WebEntities.DatabaseType")
    
##### Source control #####

The source control settings are also defined as a nested resource. Azure Resource Manager uses this resource to configure continuous publishing (see caveat on `IsManualIntegration` later) and also to kick off the deployment of application code automatically during the processing of the JSON file.

![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/examinejson-8-webappsourcecontrol.png)

`RepoUrl` and `branch` should be pretty intuitive and should point to the Git repository and the name of the branch to publish from. Again, these are defined by input parameters. 

Note in the `dependsOn` element that, in addition to the web app resource itself, `sourcecontrols/web` also depends on `config/appsettings` and `config/connectionstrings`. This is because once `sourcecontrols/web` is configured, the Azure deployment process will automatically attempt to deploy, build, and start the application code. Therefore, inserting this dependency helps you make sure that the application has access to the required app settings and connection strings before the application code is run. 

>[AZURE.NOTE] Note also that `IsManualIntegration` is set to `true`. This property is necessary in this tutorial because you do not actually own the GitHub repository, and thus cannot actually grant permission to Azure to configure continuous publishing from [ToDoApp](https://github.com/azure-appservice-samples/ToDoApp) (i.e. push automatic repository updates to Azure). Even if you own the GitHub Repo, in Azure China, setting up GitHub Credential is not supported yet.

## Deploy the resource group template yourself ##

The **Deploy to Azure** button is great, but it allows you to deploy the resource group template in azuredeploy.json only if you have already pushed azuredeploy.json to GitHub. The Azure .NET SDK also provides the tools for you to deploy any JSON template file directly from your local machine. To do this, follow the steps below:

1.	In Visual Studio, click **File** > **New** > **Project**.

2.	Click **Visual C#** > **Cloud** > **Azure Resource Group**, then click **OK**.

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/deploy-1-vsproject.png)

3.	In **Select Azure Template**, select **Blank Template** and click **OK**.

4.	Drag azuredeploy.json into the **Template** folder of your new project.

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/deploy-2-copyjson.png)

5.	From Solution Explorer, open the copied azuredeploy.json.

6.	Just for the sake of the demonstration, let's add some standard Application Insight resources to our JSON file, by clicking **Add Resource**. If you're just interested in deploying the JSON file, skip to the deploy steps.

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/deploy-3-newresource.png)

7.	Select **Application Insights for Web Apps**, then make sure an existing App Service plan and web app is selected, and then click **Add**.

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/deploy-4-newappinsight.png)

	You'll now be able to see several new resources that, depending on the resource and what it does, have dependencies on either the App Service plan or the web app. These resources are not enabled by their existing definition and you're going to change that.

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/deploy-5-appinsightresources.png)
 
8.	In the JSON Outline, click **appInsights AutoScale** to highlight its JSON code. This is the scaling setting for your App Service plan.

9.	In the highlighted JSON code, locate the `location` and `enabled` properties and set them as shown below.

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/deploy-6-autoscalesettings.png)

10.	In the JSON Outline, click **CPUHigh appInsights** to highlight its JSON code. This is an alert.

11.	Locate the `location` and `isEnabled` properties and set them as shown below. Do the same for the other three alerts (purple bulbs).

	![](./media/app-service-deploy-complex-application-predictably/deploy-7-alerts.png)

11. 由于 Azure 中国暂时还不支持 Component Insight，所以你必须删掉 component insight 这个资源，才能部署这个模板。

11. Azure China does not support Component Insight yet; hence, in order to deploy the template, you need to delete the "component insight" resource.

12.	You're now ready to deploy. Run the following powershell command to deploy your template. You need to provide parameters while deploying.

		New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName ContosoEngineering -TemplateFile .\Templates\DeploymentTemplate.json

That's it! Now you just need to go to the [Azure Portal Preview](https://portal.azure.cn/) to see the new alerts and autoscale settings added to your JSON deployed application.

Your steps in this section mainly accomplished the following:

1.	Prepared the template file
2.	Created a parameter file to go with the template file
3.	Deployed the template file with the parameter file

## Summary ##

In DevOps, repeatability and predictability are keys to any successful deployment of a high-scale application composed of microservices. In this tutorial, you have deployed a two-microservice application to Azure as a single resource group using the Azure Resource Manager template. Hopefully, it has given you the knowledge you need in order to start converting your application in Azure into a template and can provision and deploy it predictably.
