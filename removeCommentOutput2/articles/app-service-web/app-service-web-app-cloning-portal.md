# Azure App Service App Cloning Using Azure Portal Preview
The cloning feature in [Azure App Service Web Apps](/documentation/articles/app-service-changes-existing-services/) lets you easily clone existing web apps to a newly created app in a different region or in the same region. This will enable customers to deploy a number of apps across different regions quickly and easily.

App cloning is currently only supported for premium tier app service plans. The new feature uses the same limitations as Web Apps Backup feature, see [Back up a web app in Azure App Service](/documentation/articles/web-sites-backup/).

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-web-to-api-and-mobile](../../includes/app-service-web-to-api-and-mobile.md)]

## Cloning an existing App
The web app must be running in the **Premium** mode in order for you to create a clone for the web app.

1. In the [Azure Portal Preview](https://portal.azure.cn/), open your web app's blade.
2. Click **Tools**. Then, in the **Tools** blade, click **Clone App**.
   
    ![][1]
   
   > [AZURE.NOTE]
   > If the web app is not already in the **Premium** mode, you will receive a message indicating the supported modes for app cloning. At this point, you have the option to select **Upgrade**.
   > 
   > 
3. In the **Clone App** blade provide a name of the new web app, Resource Group, and App Service Plan. Also the user will be able to choose whether to clone a number of source web app settings or not.

4. After clicking **create** the platform will start working on creating a clone of the source web app.
