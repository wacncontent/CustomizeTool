## References Added

The Azure Mobile Services NuGet package was added to your project. As a result, the following .NET references were added to your project:

- **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile**
- **Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.Ext**
- **Newtonsoft.Json**
- **System.Net.Http.Extensions**
- **System.Net.Http.Primitives** 

## Connection string values for Mobile Services

In your App.xaml.cs file, a **MobileServiceClient** object was created with the selected mobile service’s application URL and application key. 

## Mobile Services project added

If a .NET mobile service is created in the Connected Service Provider, then a mobile services project is created and added to the solution.
