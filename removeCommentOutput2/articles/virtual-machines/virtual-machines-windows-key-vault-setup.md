# Set up Key Vault for virtual machines in Azure Resource Manager

> [AZURE.NOTE] Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:  [Resource Manager and classic](/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/).  This article covers using the Resource Manager deployment model, which Azure recommends for most new deployments instead of the classic deployment model

In Azure Resource Manager stack, secrets/certificates are modeled as resources that are provided by the resource provider of Key Vault. To learn more about Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](/documentation/articles/key-vault-whatis/)

In order for Key Vault to be used with Azure Resource Manager virtual machines, the *EnabledForDeployment* property on Key Vault must be set to true. You can do this in various clients.

## Use PowerShell to set up Key Vault
To create a key vault by using PowerShell, see [Get started with Azure Key Vault](/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/#vault).

For new key vaults, you can use this PowerShell cmdlet:

	New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName 'ContosoKeyVault' -ResourceGroupName 'ContosoResourceGroup' -Location 'China East' -EnabledForDeployment

For existing key vaults, you can use this PowerShell cmdlet:

	Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName 'ContosoKeyVault' -EnabledForDeployment

## Us CLI to set up Key Vault
To create a key vault by using the command-line interface (CLI), see [Manage Key Vault using CLI](/documentation/articles/key-vault-manage-with-cli/#create-a-key-vault).

For CLI, you have to create the key vault before you assign the deployment policy. You can do this by using the following command:

	azure keyvault set-policy ContosoKeyVault -enabled-for-deployment true

## Use templates to set up Key Vault
While you use a template, you need to set the `enabledForDeployment` property to `true` for the Key Vault resource.

	{
      "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults",
      "name": "ContosoKeyVault",
      "apiVersion": "2015-06-01",
      "location": "<location-of-key-vault>",
      "properties": {
        "enabledForDeployment": "true",
        ....
        ....
      }
    }

For other options that you can configure when you create a key vault by using templates, see [Create a key vault](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-key-vault-create).

>[AZURE.NOTE] Templates you downloaded from the GitHub Repo "azure-quickstart-templates" must be modified in order to fit in the Azure China Cloud Environment. For example, replace some endpoints -- "blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn" by "blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn", "chinacloudapp.cn" by "chinacloudapp.cn"; change some unsupported VM images; and, changes some unsupported VM sizes.
