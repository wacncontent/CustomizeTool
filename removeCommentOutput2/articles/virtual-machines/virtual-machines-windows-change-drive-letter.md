#How to change the drive letter of the Windows temporary disk

If you need to use the D drive to store data, follow these instructions to use a different drive for the temporary disk. Never use the temporary disk to store data that you need to keep.

Before you begin, you'll need a data disk attached to the virtual machine so you can store the Windows page file (pagefile.sys) during this procedure. See [How to attach a data disk to a Windows virtual machine][Attach] if you don't have one. For instructions on how to find out what disks are attached, see "Find the disk" in [How to detach a data disk from a Windows virtual machine][Detach].

If you want to use an existing data disk on the D drive, make sure you've also uploaded the VHD to the Storage account. For instructions, see steps 3 and 4 in [Create and upload a Windows Server VHD to Azure][VHD].

> [AZURE.WARNING] If you resize a virtual machine and doing that moves the virtual machine to a different host, the temporary disk changes back to the D drive.

##Change the drive letter

1. Log on to the virtual machine. For details, see [How to log on to a virtual machine running Windows Server][Logon].

2. Move pagefile.sys from the D drive to another drive.

3. Restart the virtual machine.

4. Log in again and change the drive letter from D to E.

5.	From the [Azure  Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.cn), attach an existing data disk or an empty data disk.

6.	Log on to the virtual machine again, initialize the disk, and assign D as the drive letter for the disk you just attached.

7.	Verify that E is mapped to the temporary disk.

8.	Move pagefile.sys from the other drive to the E drive.
