# Oracle software hosted on Linux virtual machines in Azure

Set up your first or next dev/test or production Oracle database to run on a Linux virtual machine in Azure infrastructure services. Take advantage of ease of configuration and the ability to quickly expand the Oracle database workload to include new capacity. You can also set up Oracle software on [Windows virtual machines](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-classic-oracle).

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:  [Resource Manager and classic](/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model).  This article covers using the classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model.
