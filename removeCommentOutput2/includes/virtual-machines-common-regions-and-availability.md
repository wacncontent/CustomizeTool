# Regions and availability for virtual machines in Azure
It is important to understand how and where your virtual machines (VMs) operate in Azure, along with your options to maximize performance, availability, and redundancy. Azure operates in multiple datacenters around the world. These datacenters are grouped in to geographic regions, giving you flexibility in choosing where to build your applications. This article provides you with an overview of the availability and redundancy features of Azure.

## What are Azure regions?
Azure allows you to create resources, such as VMs, in defined geographic regions like 'China North' or 'China East'. There are currently 30 Azure regions around the world. You can review the [list of regions and their locations](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/). Within each region, multiple datacenters exist to provide for redundancy and availability. This approach gives you flexibility when building your applications to create VMs closest to your users and to meet any legal, compliance, or tax purposes.

## Storage availability
Understanding Azure regions and geographies becomes important when you consider the available Azure Storage replication options. When you create a storage account, you must select one of the following replication options:

- Locally redundant storage (LRS)
    - Replicates your data three times within the region in which you created your storage account.
- Zone redundant storage (ZRS)
    - Replicates your data three times across two to three facilities, either within a single region or across two regions.
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
    - Replicates your data to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region.
- Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
    - Replicates your data to a secondary region, as with GRS, but also then provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location.

The following table provides a quick overview of the differences between the storage replication types:

| Replication strategy                                                        | LRS | ZRS | GRS | RA-GRS |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----|:----|:----|:-------|
| Data is replicated across multiple facilities.                              | No  | Yes | Yes | Yes    |
| Data can be read from the secondary location and from the primary location. | No  | No  | No  | Yes    |
| Number of copies of data maintained on separate nodes.                      | 3   | 3   | 6   | 6      |

You can read more about [Azure Storage replication options here](/documentation/articles/storage-redundancy/).

### Storage costs
Prices vary depending on the storage type and availability that you select. 

- Premium storage is backed by Solid State Drives (SSDs) and is charged based on the capacity of the disk.
- Standard storage is backed by regular spinning disks and is charged based on the in-use capacity and desired storage availability.
    - For RA-GRS, there is an additional Geo-Replication Data Transfer charge for the bandwidth of replicating that data to another Azure region.

See [Azure Storage Pricing](/pricing/details/storage/) for pricing information on the different storage types and availability options.


## Azure images
In Azure, VMs are created from an image. Typically, images are from the Azure Marketplace where partners can provide pre-configured complete OS or application images.

When you create a VM from an image in the Azure Marketplace, you are actually working with templates. Azure Resource Manager templates are declarative JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files that can be used to create complex application environments comprising VMs, storage, virtual networking, etc. You can read more about using [Azure Resource Manager templates](/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview), including how to [build your own templates](/documentation/articles/resource-group-authoring-templates/).

You can also create your own custom images and upload them using [Azure CLI](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-upload-vhd/) or [Azure PowerShell](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-upload-image/) to quickly create custom VMs to your specific build requirements.


## Availability sets
An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability. It is recommended that two or more VMs are created within an availability set to provide for a highly available application and to meet the [99.95% Azure SLA](/support/sla/virtual-machines/). The availability set is compromised of two additional groupings that protect against hardware failures and allow updates to safely be applied - fault domains (FDs) and update domains (UDs).

You can read more about how to manage the availability of [Linux VMs](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-manage-availability/) or [Windows VMs](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-manage-availability/).

### Fault domains
A fault domain is a logical group of underlying hardware that share a common power source and network switch, similar to a rack within an on-premises datacenter. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these fault domains. This approach limits the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.

### Update domains
An update domain is a logical group of underlying hardware that can undergo maintenance or be rebooted at the same time. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these update domains. This approach ensures that at least one instance of your application always remains running as the Azure platform undergoes periodic maintenance. The order of update domains being rebooted may not proceed sequentially during planned maintenance, but only one update domain is rebooted at a time.


## Next steps
You can now start to use these availability and redundancy features to build your Azure environment. For best practices information, see [Azure availability best practices](/documentation/articles/best-practices-availability-checklist/).
