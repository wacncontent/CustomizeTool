# Linux and open-source computing on Azure

This document attempts to list in one place all the topics written by Microsoft and its partners about running Linux-based Virtual Machines as well as other open-source compute environments and applications on Azure. Articles that describe the classic deployment model only are noted, as are those that use the Resource Manager deployment model. Articles that lack a deployment model note describe both deployment models.

As both Azure and the open-source computing world are fast-moving targets, it is almost certain that this document is out of date, *despite* the fact that we shall do our best to continually add newer topics and remove out-of-date ones. If we've missed one, please let us know in the comments, or submit a pull request to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wacn/techcontent/).

## General notes
The sections are broken down on the right of this page. (Links may occur in more than one section, as topics can be about more than one concept, distro, or technology.) In addition, there are several topics that describe various Linux options, image repositories, case studies, and how-to topics to upload your own custom images:

- [MSOpenTech VM Depot](https://vmdepot.msopentech.com/List/Index)
- [Events and Demonstrations: Microsoft Openness CEE](http://www.opennessatcee.com/)
- \[Classic Deployment]: [How to: Uploading your own Distro Image](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-classic-create-upload-vhd/) (and also instructions using an [Azure-Endorsed Distribution](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-endorsed-distros/))
- [Notes: General Linux Requirements to Run in Azure](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-create-upload-generic/)
- \[Classic Deployment]: [Notes: General Introduction for Linux on Azure](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-intro-on-azure/)

## Distros

There are tons of Linux distributions, usually broken down by the package management systems: Some are dpkg-based, like Debian and Ubuntu, and others are rpm-based, like CentOS, SUSE, and RedHat. Some companies provide distro images as formal partners of Microsoft and are endorsed. Others are provided by the community. The distros in this section have formal articles about them, even if they were only used in examples of other technologies.

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a very popular and Azure-endorsed Linux distribution based on dpkg and apt-get package management.

## Auth and encryption

Authentication and encryption are critical topics in software development, and there are many, many topics on the web that describe how to learn and use proper security techniques for both. We describe some of the basic usage to get up and running quickly with Linux and opensource workloads, as well pointing to tools to use to reset or remove remote security features on Azure. These are basic procedures, and we will be adding more complex scenarios soon.

## Devops, management, and optimization

This section starts with a blog entry containing a series of videos on [Video: Azure Virtual Machines : Using Chef, Puppet and Docker for managing Linux VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/12/15/azure-virtual-machines-using-chef-puppet-and-docker-for-managing-linux-vms/).
