# Deploy a high-availability line of business application in Azure
<!-- deleted by customization

This article contains links to the step-by-step instructions for deploying a high-availability, intranet-only, web-based line of business application with SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups in Azure infrastructure services. The application is hosted on these computers:

- Two web servers
- Two database servers
- One cluster majority node server
- Two domain controllers

This is the configuration, with placeholder names for each server.

At least two machines for each role ensure high availability. All of the virtual machines are in a single Azure location (also known as a region). Each group of virtual machines for a specific role is in their own availability set. 

You deploy this configuration in the following phases:

- [Phase 1: Configure Azure](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-workload-high-availability-LOB-application-phase1). Create storage accounts, availability sets, and a cross-premises virtual network.
- [Phase 2: Configure domain controllers](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-workload-high-availability-LOB-application-phase2). Create and configure replica Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controllers.
- [Phase 3: Configure SQL Server infrastructure](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-workload-high-availability-LOB-application-phase3). Create and configure the virtual machines running SQL Server, create the cluster, and enable SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups.
- [Phase 4: Configure web servers](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-workload-high-availability-LOB-application-phase4). Create and configure the two web server virtual machines.
- [Phase 5: Add the application databases to a SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Group](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-workload-high-availability-LOB-application-phase5). Prepare the line of business application databases and add them to a SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Group.

This deployment is designed to accompany the [Line of Business Applications architecture blueprint](http://msdn.microsoft.com/dn630664) and incorporate the latest recommendations.

This is a prescriptive, pre-defined architecture. Keep the following in mind:

- If you are an experienced web-based, line of business application implementer, please feel free to adapt the instructions in Phases 3 through 5 and build the application infrastructure that best suits your needs. 
- If you already have an existing Azure hybrid cloud implementation, please feel free to adapt or skip the instructions in Phases 1 and 2 to host the virtual machines for the new application on the appropriate subnet.
- All of the servers are located on a single subnet in the Azure virtual network. If you want to provide additional security equivalent to subnet isolation, you can use [Network Security Groups](/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-nsg).

To build a dev/test environment or a proof-of-concept of this configuration, see [Set up a web-based LOB application in a hybrid cloud for testing](/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-setup-lobapp-hybrid-cloud-testing).
