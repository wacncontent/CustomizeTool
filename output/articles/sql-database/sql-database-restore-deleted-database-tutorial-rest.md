## Overview

This guide shows you how to restore a deleted Azure SQL database with REST API. Links to more detailed operations are provided.

Restoring a deleted Azure SQL database creates a new database. The service automatically selects the service tier based on the backup used at the restore point. Make sure you have available quota on the logical server to create another database. If you'd like to request an increased quota, contact [Azure Support](/support/contact/).

## Restrictions and Security

See [Restore a deleted Azure SQL database in the Azure Management Portal](/documentation/articles/sql-database-restore-deleted-database-tutorial-management-portal/).
