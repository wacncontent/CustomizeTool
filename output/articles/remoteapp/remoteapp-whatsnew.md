# What's new in Azure RemoteApp?

One of the advantages of Azure RemoteApp is that we are always working to improve it. Every time we do, we'll announce those changes here.

## September 2015
- Added Infopath to the Microsoft Office 365 template and gallery image. If you want to share Infopath, make sure to update your collections with the latest image.
- Client updates:
	- Windows client updated to make it possible for users to share feedback, especially around connection issues.
	- iOS client updated to fix error messaging and to fix a problem where your credentials expired earlier than expected.
- We're working on getting Office 2016 support tested. Once that's completed, look for updated images.
- Published a new article about the [differences between cloud and hybrid collections](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-collections) - this will help you choose the collection type that works best for your apps - cloud-only, cloud + VNET, or hybrid.
- Want to share QuickBooks using Azure RemoteApp but not sure of the steps? Check out [Eric's new article](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-quickbooks) telling you exactly what to do.

## August 2015
Big changes happened in August - here are the highlights:

- You can now use an Azure VNET with a cloud collection! Check out the [cloud creation instructions](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-create-cloud-deployment) for the new steps.
- Made it possible to add apps to the **Start **menu for the Windows RemoteApp client. Apps will show up in the application list, and you can pin them to the **Start **menu in Windows.
- Added a new image to the Azure VM gallery - Windows Server Remote Desktop Session Host with Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus.
- Fixed the Mac client so apps with modal windows will stop freezing.
- Documented how you can use your [Office 365 ProPlus subscription](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-officesubscription) with Azure RemoteApp.
- Detailed how you can [secure the apps and data](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-secure) in your Azure RemoteApp collection.

## July 2015

July set the stage for changes coming in August, so there's not a lot to talk about now, mostly doc updates. Here are the most recent changes:

- Added a **Support** tab to the portal so you can more easily access support resources, like the forums.
- Reworked the troubleshooting information for creating a hybrid collection. Check out [the latest and greatest](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-hybridtrouble) for troubleshooting tips like, how to identify the correct ports to configure for your VNET.
- Documented how [user data](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-upd) is created and saved in Azure RemoteApp.
- Documented how to [lock down apps](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-secure).
- Published the [Azure RemoteApp cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/mt428031.aspx).
- And finally, we started a conversation with some Azure RemoteApp users about terminology. Look for changes to the way we refer to the different collection options.

## June 2015

So many changes! The team has been very busy in June:

- Redesigned the Azure RemoteApp [landing page](https://www.remoteapp.windowsazure.cn/) - check it out!
- Updated the software in all the images available as part of your subscription.
- Made improvements to hybrid collections, including forced tunneling support and checking IP subnet size before trying to create the collection.
- Discovered that the * wildcard doesn't work for webcams. Instead, you need to specify the instance ID or GUID. We'll be updating the redirection information to reflect that.
- Made it so you can add custom antivirus software to your image when you create a template image from the Azure gallery.

We've got more changes rolling out in July, so we'll be back with another update soon.

## May 2015

There have been a number of additions (and months) since we first created this topic, so this list cheats a bit and is from the beginning of March through May. Check out these new features:

- Automate everything - Azure RemoteApp now has [cmdlets in the Azure PowerShell module](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-tutorial-arawithpowershell).
- [Create an Azure RemoteApp image from an Azure virtual machine](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-image-on-azurevm). Makes uploading your custom image to Azure much quicker.
- Use an Azure VNET instead of a RemoteApp VNET to connect your corporate network resources to Azure. We've updated the [hybrid collection instructions](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-create-hybrid-deployment) to walk you through creating an Azure VNET (it's Step 1).
- Speaking of VNETs, check out [the new guidance](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-vnetsizing) around VNET size limits and limitations.
- And speaking of limits - just what are the [service limits and defaults](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-servicelimits)?

Want to learn more about Azure RemoteApp? The RemoteApp team was out in force at Ignite a few weeks ago. Check out Eric's video, [The Fundamentals of Windows Azure RemoteApp Management and Administration](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/2015/BRK3868).

Need to see Azure RemoteApp in the real world? Check out the [Run any app on any device anywhere](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-anyapp) tutorial - it shows you how to share Access with your users, including sharing the database files. We also have a tutorial on [making Office 365](/documentation/articles/remoteapp-tutorial-o365anywhere) run the same on any device.

Thanks for sticking with us - back next month with more updates.
