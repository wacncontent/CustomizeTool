# Create a virtual machine running Windows in the Azure Classic Management Portal

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:  [Resource Manager and classic](/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/).  This article covers using the classic deployment model. Azure recommends that most new deployments use the [Resource Manager deployment model](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-classic-tutorial/).

This tutorial shows you how easy it is to create an Azure virtual machine (VM) running Windows in the Azure Classic Management Portal. We'll use a Windows Server image as an example, but that's just one of the many images Azure offers.

You can also create VMs using [your own images](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-classic-createupload-vhd/). To learn about this and other methods, see [Different ways to create a Windows virtual machine](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-creation-choices/).

## <a id="createvirtualmachine"> </a>How to create the virtual machine

This section shows you how to use the **From Gallery** option in the Azure Classic Management Portal to create the virtual machine. This option provides more configuration choices than the **Quick Create** option. For example, if you want to join a virtual machine to a virtual network, you'll need to use the **From Gallery** option.

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can also try the richer, customizable Azure portal to create a virtual machine, use enhanced monitoring and diagnostics, use Premium storage, and more. The available options for configuring a virtual machine in the two portals overlap substantially but aren't identical. For example, use the Azure portal to configure a virtual machine with Premium storage.

## Next steps

- Log on to the virtual machine. For instructions, see [Log on to a virtual machine running Windows Server](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-classic-connect-logon/).

- Attach a disk to store data. You can attach both empty disks and disks that contain data. For instructions, see the [Attach a data disk to a Windows virtual machine created with the classic deployment model](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-classic-attach-disk/).
