##Code changes

###Code files were added to your project

An authentication startup class, **App_Start/Startup.Auth.cs** was added to your project containing startup logic for Azure AD authentication.

###Startup code was added to your project

###Your app.config or web.config file has new configuration values.

The following configuration entries have been added.
```
	`<appSettings>
    		<add key="ida:ClientId" value="ClientId from the new Azure AD App" />
    		<add key="ida:Tenant" value="Your selected Azure AD Tenant" />
    		<add key="ida:Audience" value="The App ID Uri from the wizard" />
	</appSettings>`
```

###An Azure AD App was created

An Azure AD Application was created in the directory that you selected in the wizard.
