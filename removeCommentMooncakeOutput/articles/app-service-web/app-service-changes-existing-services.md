# Azure and existing Azure services

This article outlines the changes to existing Azure services as part of the change to bring together several Azure services into [Azure Web App](/home/features/web-site/), a new integrated offering.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-web-to-api-and-mobile](../includes/app-service-web-to-api-and-mobile.md)] 

## Overview 

[Azure Web App](/home/features/web-site/) is a new and unique cloud service that enables developers to create web and mobile apps for any platform and any device. Azure is an integrated solution designed to streamline repeated coding functions, integrate with enterprise and SaaS systems, and automate business processes while meeting your needs for security, reliability, and scalability.

Azure brings together the following existing Azure services - [Websites](/home/features/web-site/), [Mobile Services](/home/features/mobile-services/), and [Biztalk Services](/home/features/biztalk-services/) into a single combined service, while adding powerful new capabilities.  Azure allows you to host the following app types: 

-   Web Apps
-   Mobile Apps
-   API Apps
-   Logic Apps

The following table explains how existing Azure services map to Azure and the app types available within it.
