# Azure Websites Offerings for Enterprise Whitepaper #

The need to reduce costs and deliver IT solutions faster in a rapidly evolving environment creates new challenges for Developers, IT Professionals, and Managers. Users are increasingly looking for their Line of Business (LOB) web sites to be quick, responsive, and available from any device. At the same time, businesses are trying to capitalize on the increased productivity and efficiency that comes from integration with cloud and mobile services, this may be something as simple as single sign-on across devices using Active Directory to collaboration in Office365 using data pulled from an internal LOB application which in turn pulls in data from the company implementation of Salesforce. [Azure Websites](/documentation/services/web-sites/) is an enterprise-class cloud service for developing, testing, and running web and mobile applications, Web APIs, and generic websites. It can be used to run corporate websites, intranet sites, business apps, and digital marketing campaigns on a global network of datacenters optimized for scale and availability, along with support for continuous integration and modern DevOps practices.  

This whitepaper highlights the capabilities of the [web sites](/home/features/web-site/) service specifically focused on running LOB web sites, covering migration of existing web sites and deployment of new LOB web sites on the platform. 

## Audience ##

IT Professionals, architects, and managers who are looking to migrate to the cloud web workloads that are currently running on-premises. Web workloads can span either Business to Employee or Business to Partners web sites.

## Introduction ##

Azure Websites is an ideal platform on which to host both external and internal web sites and services as it provides a cost-effective, highly scalable, managed solution allowing you to concentrate on delivering business value for your users rather than spending significant amounts of time and money maintaining and supporting separate environments. web sites offers a flexible platform on which to deploy your enterprise web sites offering the ability to continue to authenticate against on-premises Active Directory via integration with Windows Azure Active Directory, support of easy and quick deployments making use of your internal continuous integration and deployment practices, while automatically scaling to grow with the business needs - all on a managed platform that allows you to focus on your application and not your infrastructure. 

## Problem Definition ##

The IT landscape is changing rapidly, with a move away from hosting on traditional servers with their high capital costs on long lead times to one that uses on-demand use of services that scale automatically to handle load. IT departments are being challenged to reduce the cost and footprint of infrastructure and maintenance spend with a focus on reducing CAPEX while also increasing agility. The end of life of older infrastructure platforms, such as Windows Server 2003, is leading IT departments to review cloud migration as a potential way to avoid new long term capital costs. In the past, CIOs would make purchasing decisions for other departments; however, increasingly CMOs and other business unit heads are taking a more active role in how their budget is spent and what the return on their investment is. Increasingly, businesses need their workforce to be far more mobile than ever before with employees working remotely, spending more time with customers needing access to systems hassle free.

Business needs change monthly, weekly, daily. Businesses are looking for instant global scale with regular updated services full of new features, provided by a third party or internally.  In some cases Businesses are also looking for the capabilities to isolate their applications and access to resources whilst also making use of Public Cloud facilities. Users have higher expectations, with many making use of services in their own private lives such as Office365. They expect to have access to similar, up to date, feature rich services in their work life. To cope with this demand, IT must look to help the business to enable this through selection and integration with third party services, careful selection of platforms which can adapt to the business needs, whilst also being reliable with a total reduced cost of ownership.

Development teams are looking to deliver immediate business benefit, delivering new features on a frequent basis. They are looking for a cost effective, reliable platform which integrates with their existing tools and practices - development, test, release; and working together with IT departments automates deployment, management and alerting, all with the goal of zero downtime.

## High Level Solution ##

Web platforms and frameworks are increasingly being used to develop, test and host line of business applications.  With a typical line of business application, such as an internal employee expense system, often consisting solely of a web site with a backing database to store the data connected with the application.

Azure Websites is a good option for hosting such applications, offering scalable and reliable infrastructure which is managed and patched with near zero manual intervention and downtime. The Windows Azure platform provides many data storage options to support web sites hosted on web sites from Windows Azure SQL Database, a managed scalable relational database-as-a-service, to popular services from our partners such as ClearDB MySQL Database and MongoDB.

The following diagrams depict an example high-level solution with connectivity options for on premises resources.  The first example shows how this can be achieved using standard features of Azure Websites and the second shows how this can be achieved using the premium offering, Azure Websites Environments.

## Business Benefits ##

Azure Websites provides a host of business benefits which enable your function to be much more cost-effective and agile in delivering for the business needs. 

### PaaS Model ###

Azure Websites is built on a Platform as a Service model which provides a number of cost and efficiency savings.  No longer do you need to spend hours managing VMs, patching Operating Systems and Frameworks. web sites is an automatically patched environment which enables you to focus on managing your web sites and not VMs, leaving teams free to provide additional business value.

The PaaS Model underpinning web sites enables practitioners of the DevOps methodology to fulfill their goals. As a business this means full management and integration throughout the application entire life cycle, including development, testing, release, monitoring and management, and support. 

For development teams, continuous integration and deployment workflows can be configured from Visual Studio Team Services, GitHub, TeamCity, Hudson or BitBucket, enabling automated build, test and deployment enabling faster release cycles whilst reducing the friction involved in releasing in existing infrastructure. web sites also supports the creation of multiple testing and staging environments for your release workflow, no longer do you need to reserve or allocate hardware for these purposes, you can create as many environments as you wish and define your own promotion to release workflow. As a business you could decide to release to a test slot from source control, perform a series of tests and upon successful completion promote to a stage slot and finally swap to production with no downtime, with the added benefit that web sites hosted on web sites are preloaded and hot to provide the best possible customer experience.  In addition businesses can make use of the Testing in Production capabilities of Azure Websites to direct a section of traffic to a different slot, validate the changes, before switching all traffic to the new deployment or reverting all traffic to the previous deployment. 

Operations teams can feel confident that they are in the best possible position to react to any issues with any of their web sites hosted on web sites with the built in monitoring and alerts features. Should Operations Teams have already invested in analytics and monitoring solutions such from Microsoft Visual Studio Application Insights, New Relic and AppDynamics. These are also fully supported on web sites enabling continuity and a familiar environments from which to monitor your web sites.

Finally, web sites provides functionality to automatically back up your app(s) and hosted database(s) direct to an Azure Blob Storage container. Providing you with an easy way and very cost effective method with which to recover from disaster, reducing the need for complex on premises hardware and software.

### Ease of Migration ###

Hardware maintenance and rotation is a key issue for businesses as release cycles for hardware and operating systems speed up. Maybe you have a number of Windows Server 2003 R2 servers which are coming to the end of support in 2015 but they are still hosting key web sites for your business? Azure Websites is a great candidate on which to host those web sites and for you to rationalize the business hardware estate. web sites gives you access to a range of hardware specifications which are managed and maintained as part of the service, eliminating the need to factor in replacement and management costs as part of your infrastructure budget.  Migration can be as simple as a copy and paste operation from your existing deployment to web sites or a more complex migration where using the web sites Migration Assistant will add value. Migrated web sites enjoy the full spectrum of Azure services, integrating additional services to the web sites. For example, you can consider adding Azure Active Directory to control access to your application based on users' association to security groups. Another example can be adding Cache Services to improve performance and reduce latency, providing overall better user experience. 

### Enterprise Class Hosting ###

Azure Websites provides a stable, reliable platform which has been proven to be able to handle a wide variety of business needs from small internal development and test workloads, to highly scaled high traffic websites. By using web sites, you are making use of the same enterprise class hosting platform that Microsoft as a company uses for high value web workloads. web sites, along with all services on the Azure platform, are built with security and compliance with regulatory requirements, such as ISO (ISO/IEC 27001:2005); SOC1 and SOC2 SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 Attestations, HIPAA BAA, PCI and Fedramp, at the very heart of each element and feature, for more information please see [http://aka.ms/azurecompliance](/support/trust-center/compliance/). 

Windows Azure platform allows Role Based Authorization Controls enabling enterprise levels of control to resources within web sites. RBAC gives enterprises the power to implement their own access management policies for all of their assets in the Azure Environment, by assigning users to groups and in turn assigning the required permissions to those groups against the asset such as a web site. By utilizing web sites, you can be sure your web sites are deployed in a safe and secure environment and you have full control into which territory your assets are deployed. 
## Solution Details ##

Let's look at an example of an application migration scenario. This outlines the details of how Azure Websites features come to together to provide great solution and business value.
 
Throughout this example the line of business application we will be discussing is an expense reporting application that enables employees to submit their expenses for reimbursement. The application is hosted on a Windows Server 2003 R2 running IIS6 and the database is a SQL Server 2005 database. The reason we choose older server lies with the coming End of Service for Windows Server 2003 R2 and SQL Server 2005, and we have [tools](http://www.movemetothecloud.net/) and [guidance](http://www.movemetothecloud.net/resources) to automatically migrate workloads into Azure. With that in mind, the pattern used in this example apply to a wide verity of migration scenarios. 

### Migrate Existing Application ###

Step one of the overall solution for moving a line-of-business application to web sites is to identify the existing application assets and architecture. The example in this paper is an ASP.NET web site hosted on a single IIS Server with the database hosted on a separate SQL Server, as shown in the figure below. Employees login to the system using a username and password combination, they enter details of expenses and upload scanned copies of receipts, into the database, for each item of expense.

#### Items to consider ####

When migration application from an on-premises environment, you might want to keep in mind, few web sites constraints. Here are some key topics to be aware of when migrating web sites to web sites ([http://www.movemetothecloud.net/resources](http://www.movemetothecloud.net/resources)):

-	Port Bindings - web sites only supports port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS traffic. If your application uses any other port, then once migrated the application will make use of port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS traffic. This is often a harmless issue as it is common in on premises deployments to make use of different ports in order to overcome the use of domain names, especially in development and test environments
-	Authentication - web sites supports Anonymous Authentication by default and Forms Authentication as identified by an application. web sites can offer Windows Authentication when the application is integrated with Azure Active Directory and ADFS only. This is a feature which is discussed in more detail [here](/documentation/articles/web-sites-business-application-solution-overview/) 
-	GAC based assemblies - web sites does not allow the deployment of assemblies to the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). Therefore, if the application being migrated makes use of this feature on-premises, consider moving the assemblies to the bin folder of the application.
-	IIS5 Compatibility Mode - web sites does not support IIS5 Compatibility Mode, and as such each web sites instance and all web sites under the parent web sites instance run in the same worker process within a single application pool.
-	Use of COM Libraries - web sites does not allow the registration of COM Components on the platform. Therefore if the application is making use of any COM Components, these would need to be rewritten in managed code and deployed with the application.
-	ISAPI Filters - ISAPI Filters can be supported on web sites. They will need to be deployed as part of the application and registered in the web site's web.config file. For more information, see [http://aka.ms/azurewebsitesxdt](/documentation/articles/web-sites-transform-extend). 

Once these topics have been considered, your web site should be ready for the Cloud. And don't worry if some topics are not fully met, the migration tool will give best effort to migration. 

The next steps in the migration process are to create an Azure Websites and an Azure SQL Database. There are multiple sizes of web sites instances with varying number of CPU Cores and RAM amounts available for you to select based on your web sites requirement. For more information and pricing, see [http://aka.ms/azurewebsitesskus](/home/features/web-site/#price). Likewise, Windows Azure SQL Database caters to all of a business' needs with various service tiers and performance levels to fulfill requirements. Further information can be found at [http://aka.ms/azuresqldbskus](/home/features/sql-database/#price). Once created, the application is uploaded to Azure Websites, either via FTP or WebDeploy and then move onto the database.

When creating an Azure SQL Database a number of options are available to import an existing database from an on-premises server from generating a script of an existing database to using the [Data-tier Application Export and Import](/documentation/articles/sql-database-cloud-migrate). 

The expenses application database was created by creating a new Azure SQL Database, connecting to the database using SQL Server Management Studio and then running a script to build the database schema and populate it with data from the on-premises database.

The final step in this first stage of the migration requires the updating of connection strings to the database for the application. This can be achieved via the Azure Management Portal. For each web site you can modify application specific settings, including any connection strings being used by the application to connect to any database being used.

### Alternatives to using Azure SQL Database ###

The Azure platform offers a number of alternatives to using Azure SQL Database as a web sites primary database, this is to enable different workloads i.e. use of a NoSQL Solution or to enable the platform to suit a business' data needs. For example, a business may hold data that must not be stored off-site or in a public cloud environment, and therefore would look to maintain the use of their on-premises database.

#### Scale and Resiliency ####

As a business grows its workforce, via acquisitions or natural organic growth, so too must web sites scale to meet these new demands. Indeed today it is common to see an even greater spread of co-located teams and remote employees, for example companies with offices in the United States, Europe and Asia, with a mobile sales force in many more territories. web sites has the capability to handle elastic changes in scale comfortably and automatically.

Azure Websites allows web sites to be configured to scale automatically via the Azure Management Portal, depending on two vectors - scheduled times or by CPU usage. web sites Auto Scaling provides a cost effective and extremely flexible way to cater for greater changes in usage for all business applications, from web sites like our expense reporting system to marketing websites, which experience a high burst of traffic for a short duration of promotion. For more information and guidance on scaling your web sites using web sites, see [How to Scale Websites](/documentation/articles/web-sites-scale).

In addition to the scaling flexibility of web sites, the overall platform enables business continuity and resiliency through the possible distribution of web sites and their assets across multiple datacenters and geographic regions.

## Summary ##
Azure Websites offers a flexible, cost effective, responsive solution to the dynamic needs of a business in a rapidly evolving environment. web sites helps businesses increase productivity and efficiency by making use of a managed platform with modern DevOps capabilities and reduced hands on management, while providing enterprise capabilities in scale, resilience, security and integration with on-premises assets.
