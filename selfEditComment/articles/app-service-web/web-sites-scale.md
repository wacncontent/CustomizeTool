# Scale a web app in Azure Websites #

For increased performance and throughput for your web apps on Windows Azure, you can use the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn/) to scale your [Azure Websites](/documentation/services/web-sites/) plan from **Free** mode to **Shared**, **Basic**, **Standard**<!-- deleted by customization , or **Premium** --> mode. 
<!-- deleted by customization

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-web-to-api-and-mobile](../includes/app-service-web-to-api-and-mobile.md)]
-->

Scaling up on Azure web apps involves two related actions: changing your App Service plan mode to a higher level of service, and configuring certain settings after you have switched to the higher level of service. Both topics are covered in this article. Higher service tiers like **Standard** <!-- deleted by customization and **Premium** --> modes offer greater robustness and flexibility in determining how your resources on Azure are used.

Changing modes and configuring them is easily done in the Scale tab of the management portal. You can scale up or down as required. These changes take only seconds to apply and affect all web apps in your App Service plan. They do not require your code to be changed or your applications to be redeployed.

For information about App Service plans, see [What is an App Service Plan?](/documentation/articles/web-sites-web-hosting-plan-overview) and [App Service Plans In-Depth Overview](/documentation/articles/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview). For information the pricing and features of individual App Service plans, see [Azure Websites Pricing Details](/home/features/web-site/#price).

> [AZURE.NOTE] Before switching a web app from the **Free** mode to **Basic**, **Standard**, or **Premium** mode, you must first remove the spending caps in place for your Azure Websites subscription. To view or change options for your Windows Azure Websites subscription, see [Windows Azure Subscriptions][azuresubscriptions].

## Scaling to Standard <!-- deleted by customization or Premium --> mode
<!-- ================================= -->

> [AZURE.NOTE] Before switching an App Service plan to **Standard** <!-- deleted by customization or **Premium** --> mode, you should remove spending caps in place for your Windows Azure Websites subscription. Otherwise, you risk your web app becoming unavailable if you reach your caps before the billing period ends. To view or change options for your Windows Azure Websites subscription, see [Windows Azure Subscriptions][azuresubscriptions].

<!-- deleted by customization

1. To scale to **Standard** or **Premium** mode, follow the same initial steps as when scaling to **Shared** or **Basic**, and then choose a **Standard** or **Premium** mode in **Choose your pricing tier**, then click **Select**. 
	
	The **Notifications** tab will flash a green **SUCCESS** once the operation is complete, and **Autoscale Mode** will be enabled.
	
	![Scale in Standard or Premium Mode][ScaleStandard]
	
	You can still slide the **Instance** bar to manually scale to more instances, just like in **Basic** mode as shown above. However, here you will learn how to use **Autoscale Mode**. 
	
2. In **Autoscale Mode**, select **Performance** to autoscale based on performance metrics.
	
	![Autoscale Mode set to Performance][Autoscale]
	
3. In **Instance Range**, move the two sliders to define the minimum and maximum number of instances to scale automatically for the App Service plan. For this tutorial, move the maximum slider to **6** instances.
	
4. Click **Save** in the command bar.
	
4. Under **Target Metrics**, click **>** to configure autoscaling rules for the default metric.  
	
	![Set Target Metrics][SetTargetMetrics]
	
	You can configure autoscaling rules for different performance metrics, including CPU, memory, disk queue, HTTP queue, and data flow. Here, you will configure autoscaling for CPU percentage that does the following:
	
	- Scale up by 1 instance if CPU is above 70% in the last 10 minutes
	- Scale up by 3 instances if CPU is above 90% in the last 5 minutes
	- Scale down by 1 instance if CPU is below 50% in the last 30 minutes 
	
	
4. Leave **Metric** dropdown as **CPU Percentage**.
	
5. In **Scale up rules**, configure the first rule by setting **Condition** to **Greater**, **Threshold** to **70** (%), **Over past** to **10** (minutes), **Scale up by** to **1** (instance), and **Cool down** to **10** (minutes). 
	
	![Set First Autoscale Rule][SetFirstRule]
	
	>[AZURE.NOTE] The **Cool down** setting specifies how long this rule should wait after the previous scale action to scale again.
	
6. Click **Add Scale Up Rule**, then configure the second rule by setting **Condition** to **Greater**, **Threshold** to **90** (%), **Over past** to **1** (minutes), **Scale up by** to **3** (instance), and **Cool down** to **1** (minutes).
	
	![Set Second Autoscale Rule][SetSecondRule]
	
5. In **Scale down rules**, configure the third rule by setting **Condition** to **Less**, **Threshold** to **50** (%), **Over past** to **30** (minutes), **Scale down by** to **1** (instance), and **Cool down** to **60** (minutes). 
	
	![Set Third Autoscale Rule][SetThirdRule]
	
7. Click **Save** in the command bar. Your autoscale rule should now be reflected in the **Scale** blade. 
	
	![Set Autoscale Rule Result][SetRulesFinal]

-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
1. To scale to Standard, follow the same initial steps as when scaling to Shared or Basic, and then choose **Standard** for **App Service plan tier**. 
	
	![Choose Standard Plan][ChooseStandard]
	
	As before, the **App Service Plan Sites** section shows a short list of sites in the current plan. In this case, all sites in the current plan will be changed to Standard mode.
	
2. Selecting **Standard** expands the **Capacity** section to reveal the **Instance Size** and **Instance Count** options, which are also available in Basic mode. The **Edit Scale Settings for Schedule** and **Scale by Metric** options are available only in Standard mode.
	
	![Capacity section in Standard][CapacitySectionStandard]
	
3. Configure the **Instance Size**. The available options are **Small**, **Medium** or **Large**.
	
	![Choose instance size][ChooseInstanceSize]
	
	For more information about these instance sizes, see [Virtual Machine and Cloud Service Sizes for Windows Azure][vmsizes].
	
4. If you want to automatically scale (autoscale) resources based on daytime versus nighttime,  weekday versus weekend, and/or specific dates and times, choose **Set up schedule times** in the **Edit Scale Settings for Schedule** option.
	
	![Set up schedule times][SetUpScheduleTimesButton]
	
5. The **Set up schedule times** dialog provides a number of useful configuration choices.
	
	![SetUpScheduleTimesDialog][SetUpScheduleTimesDialog]
	
6. Under **Recurring Schedules**, select **Differing scale between Day and Night** and/or **Differing Scale between Weekday and Weekend** to scale resources based on separate daytime and nighttime schedules and/or separate weekday and weekend schedules.
	
	> [AZURE.NOTE] For the purposes of this feature, the weekend starts at the end of day Friday (8:00 PM by default), and ends at the beginning of the day on Monday (8:00 AM by default). The weekend profile uses the same day start and end that you will define in the **Time** setting.
	
7. Under **Time**, choose a start and end time for the day in half-hour increments, and a time zone. By default, the day starts at 8:00 AM and ends at 8:00 PM. Daylight Savings Time is respected for the time zone that you select. 
	
8. Under **Specific Dates**, you can create one or more named time frames for which you want to scale resources. For example, you may want to provide additional resources for a sales or launch event during which you might have large peaks in web traffic.
	
9. After you have made your choices, click **OK** to close the **Schedule Times** dialog box.
	
10.   The **Edit Scale Settings for Schedule** box now displays configurable schedules or events based on the changes you made. Select one of the recurring schedules or specific dates to configure it. 
	
	![Edit scale settings for schedule][EditScaleSettingsForSchedule]
	
	You can now use the **Scale by Metric** and the **Instance Count** features to fine tune the scaling of resources for each schedule that you choose. 
	
11.  To dynamically adjust the number of instances that your  Website uses if its load changes, enable the **Scale by Metric** option by choosing **CPU**.
	
	![Scale By Metric][ScaleByMetric]
	
	The graph shows the number of instances that have been used over the past week. You can use the graph to monitor scaling activity.
	
12. **Scale by Metric** modifies the **Instance Count** feature so that you can set the minimum and maximum number of virtual machines to be used for automatic scaling. Azure will never go above or below the limits that you set.
	
	![Instance count][InstanceCount]
	
13. **Scale by Metric** also enables the **Target CPU** option so that you can specify a target range for CPU usage. This range represents average CPU usage for your  Website. Windows Azure will add or remove Standard instances to keep your  Website in this range.
	
	![Target CPU][TargetCPU]
	
	**Note**: When **Scale by Metric** is enabled, Windows Azure checks the CPU of your  Website once every five minutes and adds instances as needed at that point in time. If CPU usage is low, Windows Azure will remove instances once every two hours to ensure that your  Website remains performant. Generally, putting the minimum instance count at 1 is appropriate. However, if you have sudden usage spikes on your  Website, be sure that you have a sufficient minimum number of instances to handle the load. For example, if you have a sudden spike of traffic during the 5 minute interval before Windows Azure checks your CPU usage, your site might not be responsive during that time. If you expect sudden, large amounts of traffic, set the minimum instance count higher to anticipate these bursts. 
	
14. After you have finished making changes to the items in the **Edit Scale Settings for Schedule** list, click the **Save** icon in the command bar at the bottom of the page to save all schedule settings at once (you do not have to save each schedule individually).

##Scaling a SQL Server Database connected to your web app
If you have one or more SQL Server databases linked to your web app (regardless of App Service plan mode), you can quickly scale them based on your needs.

<!-- deleted by customization

1. To scale one of the linked databases, open your web app's blade in the [Azure Management Portal][portal]. In the **Essentials** collapsible dropdown, click the **Resource group** link. Then, in the **Summary** part of the resource group blade, clicked one of the linked databases.

	![Linked database][ResourceGroup]
	
2. In your linked SQL Database blade, click the **Pricing tier** part, select one of the tiers based on your performance requirement, and click **Select**. 
	
	![Scale your SQL Database][ScaleDatabase]
	
3. You can also set up geo-replication to increase the high availability and disaster recovery capabilities of your SQL Database. To do this, click the **Geo Replication** part.
	
	![Set up geo-replication for SQL Database][GeoReplication]

-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
1. To scale one of the databases, in the **Linked Resources** section, click the **Manage scale for this database** link next to the name of the database.
	
	![Linked database][LinkedResources]
	
2. The link takes you to the SQL Server tab of the Azure Management Portal, where you can configure the **Edition** and **Maximum Size** of the database:
	
	![Scale your SQL Server database][ScaleDatabase]
	
	For **Edition**, choose **BASIC** or **STANDARD** depending on the storage capacity that you require. For the future of the **Web** and **BUSINESS** editions, see [Web and Business Edition Sunset FAQ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/dn741330.aspx).
	
	The value you choose for **Max Size** specifies an upper limit for the database. Database charges are based on the amount of data that you actually store, so changing the **Max Size** property does not by itself affect your database charges. For more information, see [Accounts and Billing in Windows Azure SQL Database][SQLaccountsbilling].
