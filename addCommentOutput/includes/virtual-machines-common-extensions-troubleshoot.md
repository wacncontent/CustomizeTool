>[AZURE.NOTE] Templates you downloaded from the GitHub Repo "azure-quickstart-templates" must be modified in order to fit in the Azure China Cloud Environment. For example, replace some endpoints -- "blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn" by "blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn", "chinacloudapp.cn" by "chinacloudapp.cn"; change some unsupported VM images; and, changes some unsupported VM sizes.

Azure Resource Manager templates allows you to declaratively specify the Azure IaaS infrastructure in JSON language by defining the dependencies between resources.
