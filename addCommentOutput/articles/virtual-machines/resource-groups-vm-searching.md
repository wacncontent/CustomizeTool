# Navigate and select Azure virtual machine images with Windows PowerShell and the Azure CLI

<!-- deleted by customization
[AZURE.INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)] classic deployment model.


This article describes how to navigate and select virtual machine images, using a recent installation of either the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell. As a prerequisite, you would need to change to the Resource Manager mode. With the Azure CLI, enter that mode by typing `azure config mode arm`. With PowerShell, type `Switch-AzureMode AzureResourceManager`. See [Using Azure CLI with Resource Manager](/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-azure-resource-manager) and [Using Azure PowerShell with Azure Resource Manager](/documentation/articles/powershell-azure-resource-manager) for more complete update and configuration details.

## Azure CLI

The easiest and quickest way to locate an image to use either with `azure vm quick-create` or to create a resource group template file is to call the `azure vm image list` command and pass the location, the publisher name (it's not case-sensitive!), and an offer -- if you know the offer. For example, the following list is only a short example -- many lists are quite long -- if you know that "Canonical" is a publisher for the "UbuntuServer" offer.

<!-- deleted by customization
    azure vm image list westus canonical ubuntuserver

<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
    azure vm image list chinanorth canonical ubuntuserver

The **Urn** column will be the form you pass to `azure vm quick-create`.

Often, however, you don't yet know what is available. In this case, you can navigate images by discovering publishers first <!-- deleted by customization by --> using `azure vm image list-publishers` and responding to the location prompt with a data center location you expect to use for your resource group. For example, the following lists all image publishers in the China North location (pass the location argument by lowercasing and removing spaces from the standard locations)

    azure vm image list-publishers
    info:    Executing command vm image list-publishers
<!-- deleted by customization
    Location: westus
    + Getting virtual machine image publishers (Location: "westus")
-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
    Location: chinanorth
    + Getting virtual machine image publishers (Location: "chinanorth")
<!-- keep by customization: end -->
    data:    Publisher                                       Location
    data:    ----------------------------------------------  --------
    data:    a10networks                                     <!-- deleted by customization westus --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> chinanorth <!-- keep by customization: end -->

    data:    AlertLogic.Extension                            <!-- deleted by customization westus --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> chinanorth <!-- keep by customization: end -->


These lists can be quite long, so <!-- deleted by customization the --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> above <!-- keep by customization: end --> example list <!-- deleted by customization above --> is just a snippet. Let's say that I noticed that Canonical is, indeed, an image publisher in the China North location. You can now find their offers by calling `azure vm image <!-- deleted by customization list-offers` --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> list-offers <!-- keep by customization: end --> and pass the location and the publisher at the prompts, like the following example:

    azure vm image list-offers
    info:    Executing command vm image list-offers
<!-- deleted by customization
    Location: westus
-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
    Location: chinanorth
<!-- keep by customization: end -->
    Publisher: canonical
    + Getting virtual machine image offers (Publisher: "canonical" <!-- deleted by customization Location:"westus") --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> Location:"chinanorth") <!-- keep by customization: end -->
    data:    Publisher  Offer         Location
    data:    ---------  ------------  --------
    data:    canonical  UbuntuServer  <!-- deleted by customization westus --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> chinanorth <!-- keep by customization: end -->
    info:    vm image list-offers command OK

Now we know that in the China North region, Canonical publishes the **UbuntuServer** offer on Azure. But what <!-- deleted by customization SKUs --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> skus <!-- keep by customization: end -->? To get those <!-- deleted by customization, --> you call `azure vm image list-skus` and respond to the prompt with the location, publisher, and offer <!-- deleted by customization that --> you have discovered.

    azure vm image list-skus
    info:    Executing command vm image list-skus
<!-- deleted by customization
    Location: westus

With this information, you can now find exactly the image you want by calling the original call at the top.

## PowerShell

When creating a new virtual machine with Azure Resource Manager, in some cases you need to specify an image with the combination of the following image properties:

- Publisher
- Offer
- SKU

For example, these values are needed for the **Set-AzureVMSourceImage** PowerShell cmdlet or with a resource group template file in which you must specify the type of virtual machine to be created.

If you need to determine these values, you can navigate the images to determine these values:

1. List the image publishers.
2. For a given publisher, list their offers.
3. For a given offer, list their SKUs.

To do this in PowerShell, first switch to the Resource Manager mode of Azure PowerShell.

	Switch-AzureMode AzureResourceManager

For the first step above, list the publishers with these commands.

	$locName="<Azure location, such as China North>"
	Get-AzureVMImagePublisher -Location $locName | Select PublisherName

Fill in your chosen publisher name and run these commands.

	$pubName="<publisher>"
	Get-AzureVMImageOffer -Location $locName -Publisher $pubName | Select Offer

Fill in your chosen offer name and run these commands.

	$offerName="<offer>"
	Get-AzureVMImageSku -Location $locName -Publisher $pubName -Offer $offerName | Select Skus

From the display of the **Get-AzureVMImageSku** command, you have all the information you need to specify the image for a new virtual machine.

Here is an example.

	PS C:\> $locName="China North"
	PS C:\> Get-AzureVMImagePublisher -Location $locName | Select PublisherName

	PublisherName
	-------------
	a10networks
	aiscaler-cache-control-ddos-and-url-rewriting-
	alertlogic
	AlertLogic.Extension
	Barracuda.Azure.ConnectivityAgent
	barracudanetworks
	basho
	boxless
	bssw
	Canonical
	...

For the "MicrosoftWindowsServer" publisher:

	PS C:\> $pubName="MicrosoftWindowsServer"
	PS C:\> Get-AzureVMImageOffer -Location $locName -Publisher $pubName | Select Offer

	Offer
	-----
	WindowsServer

For the "WindowsServer" offer:

	PS C:\> $offerName="WindowsServer"
	PS C:\> Get-AzureVMImageSku -Location $locName -Publisher $pubName -Offer $offerName | Select Skus

	Skus
	----
	2008-R2-SP1
	2012-Datacenter
	2012-R2-Datacenter
	Windows-Server-Technical-Preview

From this list, copy the chosen SKU name, and you have all the information for the **Set-AzureVMSourceImage** PowerShell cmdlet or for a resource group template file that requires you to specify the publisher, offer, and SKU for an image.
