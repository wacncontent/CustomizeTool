# App model v2.0 preview: Sign-in Microsoft Account & Azure AD users in a single app

> [AZURE.NOTE]
	This information applies to the v2.0 app model public preview.  For instructions on how to integrate with the generally available Azure AD service, please refer to the [Azure Active Directory Developer Guide](/documentation/articles/active-directory-developers-guide).

In the past, an app developer who wanted to support both Microsoft accounts and Azure Active Directory was required to integrate with two separate systems. With the v2.0 app model, you can now sign users in with both types of accounts. One simple integration allows you to reach an audience that spans millions of users with both personal and work/school accounts.

Your apps can also consume a [set of Office 365 REST <!-- deleted by customization APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/authenticate-Office-365-APIs-using-v2) --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> APIs](https://www.msdn.com/office/office365/howto/authenticate-Office-365-APIs-using-v2) <!-- keep by customization: end --> using either type of account.  Currently, these APIs include Outlook's Mail, Contacts, and Calendars APIs.  Additional services will be added in the near future.
<!-- TODO: customer reference article -->
<!-- Several apps have already begun to bridge the gap between consumer and enterprise accounts, including: [Boomerang](), [TripIt](), & [Uber](). -->

The v2.0 app model is in preview.  During the preview period, we are eager to hear your feedback and experience with the new app model as you try things out.  Based on that feedback, we may make breaking changes in the interest of improving the service.  You should not release a production app using the v2.0 app model during this period.
<!-- TODO: Get approval on how it looks  -->

## Getting Started
There are two ways to get your own app up & running with the v2.0 app model.  You can choose to send protocol messages directly, using [OAuth 2.0](/documentation/articles/active-directory-v2-protocols#oauth2-authorization-code-flow) or [Open ID Connect](/documentation/articles/active-directory-v2-protocols#openid-connect-sign-in-flow).  Alternatively you can use our libraries to do the work for you - choose your favorite platform below and get started.
