This tutorial walks you through the creation of a [PowerShell Workflow runbook](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types#powerShell-workflow-runbooks) in Azure Automation.  We'll start with a simple runbook that we'll test and publish while we explain how to track the status of the runbook job.  Then we'll modify the runbook to actually manage Azure resources, in this case starting an Azure virtual machine.  We'll then make the runbook more robust by adding runbook parameters.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following.

- Azure subscription. If you don't have one yet, you can <!-- deleted by customization [activate your MSDN subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or <a href="/pricing/1rmb-trial/" target="_blank">[sign --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> [sign <!-- keep by customization: end --> up for a trial](/pricing/1rmb-trial/).
- [Automation account](/documentation/articles/automation-configuring) to hold the runbook.
- An Azure virtual machine.  We will stop and start this machine so it should not be production.
- [Azure Active Directory user and Automation Credential asset](/documentation/articles/automation-configuring) to authenticate to Azure resources.  This user must have permission to start and stop the virtual machine.

## Step 1 - Create new runbook

We'll start by creating a simple runbook that outputs the text *Hello World*.

<!-- deleted by customization
1. In the Azure Preview Portal, open your Automation account.  
The Automation account page gives you a quick view of the resources in this account.  You should already have some Assets.  Most of those are the modules that are automatically included in a new Automation account.  You should also have the Credential asset that's mentioned in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
2. Click on the **Runbooks** tile to open the list of runbooks.<br>
![Runbooks control](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/runbooks-control.png)
2. Create a new runbook by clicking on the **Add a runbook** button and then **Create a new runbook**.
3. Give the runbook the name *MyFirstRunbook-Workflow*.
4. In this case, we're going to create a [PowerShell Workflow runbook](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types#powerShell-workflow-runbooks) so select **Powershell Workflow** for **Runbook type**.<br>
![New runbook](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/new-runbook.png)
5. Click **Create** to create the runbook and open the textual editor.
-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
1. In the Azure Management Portal, click **NEW** > **APP SERVICES** > **AUTOMATION** > **RUNBOOK** > **QUICK CREATE**
2. Enter the **RUNBOOK NAME**, **DESCRIPTION**, and choose an **AUTOMATION ACCOUNT**. If you don't have one, you can create one by choosing **Create a new automation account** and entering the **ACCOUNT NAME**
3. After the runbook being created, you can find it under the **RUNBOOKS** tile of you automation account.
4. Click the **AUTHOR** tile of you runbook to enable the textual editor.
<!-- keep by customization: end -->

## Step 2 - Add code to the runbook

You can either type code directly into the runbook, or you can select cmdlets, runbooks, and assets from the Library control and have them added to the runbook with any related parameters.  For this walkthrough, we'll type directly into the runbook.

1. Our runbook is currently empty with only the required *workflow* keyword, the name of our runbook, and the braces that will encase the entire workflow. <br>
![Runbooks control](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/empty-runbook.png)
2. Type *Write-Output "Hello World."* between the braces. <br>
![Hello world](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/hello-world.png)
3.   Save the runbook by clicking **Save**.<br>
<!-- deleted by customization
![Save runbook](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/runbook-edit-toolbar-save.png)
-->

## Step 3 - Test the runbook

Before we publish the runbook to make it available in production, we want to test it to make sure that it works properly.  When you test a runbook, you run its **Draft** version and view its output interactively.  
 
<!-- deleted by customization
2. Click **Test pane** to open the Test pane.<br>
![Test pane](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/runbook-edit-toolbar-test-pane.png)
2. Click **Start** to start the test.  This should be the only enabled option.
3. A [runbook job](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-execution) is created and its status displayed.  
The job status will start as *Queued* indicating that it is waiting for a runbook worker in the cloud to come available.  It will then move to *Starting*  when a worker claims the job, and then *Running* when the runbook actually starts running.  
4. When the runbook job completes, its output is displayed.  In our case, we should see *Hello World*.<br>
![Hello World](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/test-output-hello-world.png)
5. Close the Test pane to return to the canvas.
-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
2. Click **Test** to open the Test pane. And then, click **Yes** to confirm.
3. After a few seconds you will see output pane printing the message *"Hello World."*
<!-- keep by customization: end -->

## Step 4 - Publish and start the runbook

The runbook that we just created is still in Draft mode. We need to publish it before we can run it in production.  When you publish a runbook, you overwrite the existing Published version with the Draft version.  In our case, we don't have a Published version yet because we just created the runbook. 

1. Click **Publish** to publish the runbook and then **Yes** when <!-- deleted by customization prompted.<br> --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> prompted. <!-- keep by customization: end -->
<!-- deleted by customization
![Publish](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/runbook-edit-toolbar-publish.png)
2. If you scroll left to view the runbook in the **Runbooks** pane now, it will show an **Authoring Status** of **Published**.
3. Scroll back to the right to view the pane for **MyFirstRunbook-Workflow**.  
The options across the top allow us to start the runbook, schedule it to start at some time in the future, or create a [webhook](/documentation/articles/automation-webhooks) so it can be started through an HTTP call. 
4. We just want to start the runbook so click **Start** and then **Yes** when prompted.<br>
![Start runbook](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/runbook-toolbar-start.png)
5. A job pane is opened for the runbook job that we just created.  We can close this pane, but in this case we'll leave it open so we can watch the job's progress.
6.  The job status is shown in **Job Summary** and matches the statuses that we saw when we tested the runbook.<br>
![Job Summary](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/job-pane-summary.png)
7.  Once the runbook status shows *Completed*, click **Output**.  The Output pane is opened, and we can see our *Hello World*.<br>
![Job Summary](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/job-pane-output.png)  
8.  Close the Output pane.
9.  Click **Streams** to open the Streams pane for the runbook job.  We should only see *Hello World* in the output stream, but this can show other streams for a runbook job such as Verbose and Error if the runbook writes to them.<br>
![Job Summary](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/job-pane-streams.png) 
9. Close the Streams pane and the Job pane to return to the MyFirstRunbook pane.
9.  Click **Jobs** to open the Jobs pane for this runbook.  This lists all of the jobs created by this runbook.  We should only see one job listed since we only ran the job once.<br>
![Jobs](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/runbook-control-jobs.png) 
9. You can click on this job to open the same Job pane that we viewed when we started the runbook.  This allows you to go back in time and view the details of any job that was created for a particular runbook.
-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
2. If you view the runbook in the **Runbooks** tile of you automation account now, it will show an **Authoring Status** of **Published**.
4. Click **Start** to start the runbook and then **Yes** when prompted.
5. Click **View Job** to see the summary of the job you just started.
6. The job status is shown in **Job Summary**, and after a few seconds, the same output as the testing you have done earlier will be shown under **output**.
9. Go back to your runbook. Under the **Jobs** tile, you can seen a list of job created will filter above.
10. Click a job, you can see the **summary** and **history** of the job. 
<!-- keep by customization: end -->

## Step 5 - Add authentication to manage Azure resources

We've tested and published our runbook, but so far it doesn't do anything useful.  We want to have it manage Azure resources.  It won't be able to do that though unless we have it authenticate using the credentials that are referred to in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).  We do that with the **Add-AzureAccount** cmdlet.

<!-- deleted by customization
1.  Open the textual editor by clicking **Edit** on the MyFirstRunbook-Workflow pane.<br>
![Edit runbook](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/runbook-toolbar-edit.png) 
-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
1.  Open the textual editor by clicking **Author** tile > **Draft** tag > **Edit runbook**.
<!-- keep by customization: end -->
2.  We don't need the **Write-Output** line anymore, so go ahead and delete it.
3.  Position the cursor on a blank line between the braces.
<!-- deleted by customization
3.  In the Library control, expand **Assets** and then **Credentials**.
4.  Right click your credential and click **Add to canvas**.  This adds a **Get-AutomationPSCredential** activity for your credential.
-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
3.  Click **Insert** > **Setting** > **Get Windows PowerShell Credential**, choose the credential you want.
4.  If you don't have a credential, you can add one by clicking **Manage** > **Add Credential** to create one. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory user and Automation Credential asset](/documentation/articles/automation-configuring).
<!-- keep by customization: end -->
5.  In front of **Get-AutomationPSCredential**, type *$Credential =* to assign the credential to a variable. 
<!-- deleted by customization
3.  On the next line, type *Add-AzureAccount -Credential $Credential*. <br>
![Authenticate](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/authentication.png) 
3. Click **Test pane** so that we can test the runbook.
10 <!-- deleted by customization. Click **Start** to start the test -->.  Once it completes, you should receive output similar to the following that returns the information for the user in the credential.  This confirms that the credential is valid.<br>
![Authenticate](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/authentication-test.png) 
-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
3.  On the next line, type *Add-AzureAccount -Credential $Credential -Environment AzureChinaCloud*.

		workflow test
		{
    		$Credential = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name "<your credential>"
    		Add-AzureAccount -Credential $Credential -Environment AzureChinaCloud
		}

3. Click **Test** and then **Yes** when prompted.
10 <!-- deleted by customization. Click **Start** to start the test -->.  Once it completes, you should receive output similar to the following that returns the information for the user in the credential.  This confirms that the credential is valid.<br>
![Authenticate](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/authentication-test.png) 
<!-- keep by customization: end -->

## Step 6 - Add code to start a virtual machine

Now that our runbook is authenticating to our Azure subscription, we can manage resources.  We'll add a command to start a virtual machine.  You can pick any virtual machine in your Azure subscription, and for now we'll be hardcoding that name into the cmdlet. 

<!-- deleted by customization

1. After *Add-AzureAccount*, type *Start-AzureVM -Name 'VMName' -ServiceName 'VMServiceName'* providing the name and service name of the virtual machine to start. <br>
![Authenticate](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/start-azurevm.png) 
9. Save the runbook and then click **Test pane** so that we can test it.
10. Click **Start** to start the test.  Once it completes, check that the virtual machine was started.
-->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
1. After *Add-AzureAccount*, type *Start-AzureVM -Name 'VMName' -ServiceName 'VMServiceName'* providing the name and service name of the virtual machine to start. 

		workflow test
		{
    		$Credential = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name "<your credential>"
    		Add-AzureAccount -Credential $Credential -Environment AzureChinaCloud
    		Start-AzureVM -Name "<your vm>" -ServiceName "<your vm service>"
		}

9. Save the runbook and then click **Test** so that we can test it.
<!-- keep by customization: end -->


## Step 7 - Add an input parameter to the runbook

Our runbook currently starts the virtual machine that we hardcoded in the runbook, but it would be more useful if we could specify the virtual machine when the runbook is started.  We will now add input parameters to the runbook to provide that functionality.

1. Add parameters for *VMName* and *VMServiceName* to the runbook and use these variables with the **Start-AzureVM** cmdlet as in the following image. <br>
<!-- deleted by customization ![Authenticate](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/params.png) -->
<!-- keep by customization: begin -->
		workflow test
		{
    		Param (
        		[string]$VMName,
        		[String]$VMServiceName
    		)
    
    		$Credential = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name "<your credential>"
    		Add-AzureAccount -Credential $Credential -Environment AzureChinaCloud
    		Start-AzureVM -Name $VMName -ServiceName $VMServiceName
		}

<!-- keep by customization: end -->
9. Save the runbook and open the Test pane.  Note that you can now provide values for the two input variables that will be used in the test. 
11.  Close the Test pane.
12.  Click **Publish** to publish the new version of the runbook.
13.  Stop the virtual machine that you started in the previous step.
13.  Click **Start** to start the runbook.  Type in the **VMName** and **VMServiceName** for the virtual machine that you're going to <!-- deleted by customization start.<br> --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> start. <!-- keep by customization: end -->
<!-- deleted by customization
![Start Runbook](./media/automation-first-runbook-textual/start-runbook-input-params.png) 

-->
14.  When the runbook completes, check that the virtual machine was started.
